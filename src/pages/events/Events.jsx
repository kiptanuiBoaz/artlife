          Art-Life Group has determined that to create change towards our vision
          of greater Nairobi as a creative city, we must develop, incubate,
          maintain and grow initiatives that directly impact Kenyaâ€™s artists and
          its creative interlocutors in and within our communities. These
          initiatives serve our strategic goals of increasing public engagement
          with the arts from creation to participation to appreciation,
          increasing inclusion to ensure that the arts reflect the diversity of
          greater Nairobi, and encouraging artistic excellence.
